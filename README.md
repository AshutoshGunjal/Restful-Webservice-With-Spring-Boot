### Building a Robust REST API

Creating a high-quality REST API involves a set of key considerations:

- **Resource Identification**: Identify the resources you want to expose, like `/users`, `/users/{id}`, or `/posts`.

- **Action Definition**: Determine the actions your API will support, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more.

- **Request and Response Design**: Carefully define the structures for requests and responses, ensuring consistency.

- **Status Codes**: Use appropriate response status codes (e.g., 200, 404, 500) to convey meaningful information to clients.

- **Best Practices**: Embrace REST API best practices, focusing on the consumer's perspective. Consider validation, internationalization, exception handling, HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State), versioning, and comprehensive documentation.

A well-designed REST API caters to both your application's needs and the expectations of its consumers, leading to an efficient and user-friendly API.

3. **Simple Hello World REST APIs**

Experience the Spring Boot magic by building three straightforward Hello World REST APIs. This exercise will help you grasp the fundamentals of crafting REST APIs with Spring Boot.

Key Concepts:

- **@RestController**: Annotate your controllers with `@RestController` to define them as REST endpoints, allowing them to respond to HTTP requests.

- **@RequestMapping**: Use `@RequestMapping` to map URL paths to specific controller methods.

- **@PathVariable**: Employ `@PathVariable` to extract values from the URL and pass them as method parameters.

- **JSON Conversion**: Spring Boot simplifies JSON conversion for handling data between your API and clients.

This hands-on practice will introduce you to the core elements of building RESTful APIs with Spring Boot.
